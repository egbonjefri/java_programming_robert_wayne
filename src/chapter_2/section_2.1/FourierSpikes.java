/**
 * This program plots the function (cos(t) + cos(2t) + cos(3t) + ... + cos(nt)) / n
 * for 500 equally spaced samples of t from -10 to 10 (in radians).
 * 
 * The function converges to a spike (0 everywhere except at a single value) due to:
 * 
 * 1. Interference of Cosine Waves: Each term in the series cos(kt) is a cosine wave with a different
 *    frequency. These waves interfere with each other, and at most points, their positive and negative
 *    parts cancel out, especially when t is not near zero.
 * 
 * 2. Constructive Interference at t = 0: At t = 0, all cosine terms are equal to 1, leading to their
 *    constructive interference and a maximum sum value before normalization.
 * 
 * 3. Gibbs Phenomenon: Similar to the overshooting observed in Fourier series around discontinuities,
 *    the sum of waves tends to create ripples or spikes near t = 0. As n increases, the sum gets
 *    sharper and more localized around this point.
 * 
 * 4. Normalization by n: The sum of cosines is divided by n. While the sum at t = 0 increases linearly
 *    with n, after division, the peak value remains constant at 1. For other t values, the cosines
 *    don't add constructively, so their normalized sum tends to 0.
 * 
 * As a result, for large n, the function converges to 0 for most t values except near t = 0, where it
 * spikes to 1, creating a sharp, spike-like plot.
