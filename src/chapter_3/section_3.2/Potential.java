/*
 * Electric potential visualization.
 *  Write a program Potential that creates an array of
charged particles from values given on standard
input (each charged particle is speciÔ¨Åed by its x-
coordinate, y-coordinate, and charge value) and
produces a visualization of the electric potential in
the unit square. To do so, sample points in the unit
square. For each sampled point, compute the elec-
tric potential at that point (by summing the electric
potentials due to each charged particle) and plot
the corresponding point in a shade of gray propor-
tional to the electric potential.
