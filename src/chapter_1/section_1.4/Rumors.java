/*
 * Alice is throwing a party with n other guests, including Bob. Bob
starts a rumor about Alice by telling it to one of the other guests. A person hear-
ing this rumor for the Ô¨Årst time will immediately tell it to one other guest, chosen
uniformly at random from all the people at the party except Alice and the person
from whom they heard it. If a person (including Bob) hears the rumor for a second
time, he or she will not propagate it further. Write a program to estimate the prob-
ability that everyone at the party (except Alice) will hear the rumor before it stops
propagating. Also calculate an estimate of the expected number of people to hear
the rumor.
