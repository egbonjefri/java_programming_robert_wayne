/*
 * Write a program that takes three double command-line ar-
guments R, r, and a and draws the resulting spirograph. A spirograph (technically,
an epicycloid) is a curve formed by rolling a circle of radius r around a larger Ô¨Åxed
circle of radius R. If the pen offset from the center of the rolling circle is (r + a), then
the equation of the resulting curve at time t is given by
x(t ) = (R + r ) cos (t ) - (r + a ) cos ((R + r )t /r)
y(t ) = (R + r ) sin (t ) - (r + a ) sin ((R + r )t /r)
Such curves were popularized by a best-selling toy that contains discs with gear
teeth on the edges and small holes that you could put a pen in to trace spirographs.
