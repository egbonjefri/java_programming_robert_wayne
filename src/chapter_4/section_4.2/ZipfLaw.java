 * Find the frequency distribution of words in your favorite novel. Does it
obey Zipf â€™s law?

* Zipf's law is an empirical law that describes the frequency distribution of words in a language.
* Named after the linguist George Zipf, it states that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional
* to its rank in the frequency table. 
* This means that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often
* as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on.

To verify Zipf's law in a dataset:
- Rank the words by their frequencies.
- Multiply the frequency of each word by its rank.
- Check if the product is approximately constant across different ranks.
