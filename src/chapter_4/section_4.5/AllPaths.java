/*
 * Write a Graph client AllPaths whose constructor takes a Graph
as argument and supports operations to count or print all simple paths between
two given vertices s and t in the graph. A simple path is a path that does not repeat
any vertices. In two-dimensional grids, such paths are referred to as self-avoiding
walks (see SECTION 1.4). Enumerating paths is a fundamental problem in statistical
physics and theoretical chemistryâ€”for example, to model the spatial arrangement
of linear polymer molecules in a solution. Warning : There might be exponentially
many paths.
