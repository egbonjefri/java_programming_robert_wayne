/* 
 * In the Josephus problem from antiquity, n people are
in dire straits and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They
arrange themselves in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to n - 1) and proceed
around the circle, eliminating every mth person until only one person is left. Leg-
end has it that Josephus Ô¨Ågured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated. Write
a Queue client Josephus that takes two integer command-line arguments m and
n and prints the order in which people are eliminated (and thus would show Jose-
phus where to sit in the circle).
