# Computer Science Programming with Java

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the programming challenges from the book "Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. The challenges cover a wide range of topics in computer science, focusing on Java programming.

## Contents

The repository is organized according to the book's structure, with four main sections:



### 1. Elements of Programming
- **Your First Program**: Basic introduction to writing and running your first Java program.
- **Built-in Types of Data**: Manipulating strings, integers, and other primitive types.
- **Conditionals and Loops**: Exploring control flow structures including `if`, `while`, and `for`.
- **Arrays**: Understanding array structures and implementing basic operations.
- **Input and Output**: Reading from and writing to standard input and output.
- **Case Study: Random Web Surfer**: Simulating a web surfer using random walks and Markov chains.

### 2. Functions and Modules
- **Defining Functions**: Writing reusable functions and understanding function scope.
- **Libraries and Clients**: Using external libraries and building client programs.
- **Recursion**: Solving problems recursively, including classic examples like the Towers of Hanoi and Euclid's algorithm.
- **Case Study: Percolation**: Implementing percolation detection and simulation.

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming
- **Using Data Types**: Working with existing data types and understanding encapsulation.
- **Creating Data Types**: Designing custom data types with constructors and methods.
- **Designing Data Types**: Understanding inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in class design.
- **Case Study: N-Body Simulation**: Simulating gravitational interactions between celestial bodies.

### 4. Algorithms and Data Structures
- **Performance**: Analyzing algorithmic performance and applying Big-O notation.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Implementing efficient algorithms for sorting and searching data.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Utilizing stack and queue data structures in various contexts.
- **Symbol Tables**: Implementing and using symbol tables, hash tables, and binary search trees.
- **Case Study: Small-World Phenomenon**: Exploring graph-based algorithms to model real-world networks.

## Key Topics
- **Basic Programming Constructs**: Loops, conditionals, arrays, and input/output handling.
- **Recursion and Algorithm Design**: Recursive algorithms, dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer strategies.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Defining and designing data types with a focus on reusability and abstraction.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation of fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and symbol tables.
- **Graphs and Networks**: Graph-based problem-solving including shortest paths and connected components.

## Case Studies

The repository includes solutions to several in-depth case studies:

- Random Web Surfer
- Percolation
- N-Body Simulation
- Small-World Phenomenon

## How to Run
Each section contains Java programs that can be run from the command line. You can compile and execute the programs using the following commands:

```bash
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Basic understanding of Java programming
